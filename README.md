The Language Translation Tool is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) application that performs automatic machine translation between human languages using Transformer-based deep learning models.

üß† Core Concept: Neural Machine Translation (NMT)

The project uses Neural Machine Translation, which maps input text from a source language to a target language using deep neural networks.

Unlike phrase-based models, NMT handles contextual translation and learns linguistic structure directly from large parallel corpora.

‚öôÔ∏è Model Architecture: Transformer

The system uses Transformer architecture with an encoder-decoder structure:

Encoder processes input text and converts it into a context-rich representation.

Decoder generates the translated sentence from that representation.

Pre-trained models such as:

MarianMT (Helsinki-NLP models)

T5 (Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer)are used via the Hugging Face Transformers library.

üì∂ Workflow Pipeline

Input Text: User provides source language sentence.

Tokenization: Text is tokenized using a model-specific tokenizer.

Model Inference: The Transformer model predicts token IDs for the target language.

Decoding: The predicted tokens are converted back to readable text.

Output: Translated sentence is displayed to the user.

üß∞ Technologies Used

Python

Hugging Face Transformers for model loading and inference

Tokenizers like AutoTokenizer, MarianTokenizer

Streamlit / Flask for UI (optional)

üß† Why It Works

The Transformer‚Äôs self-attention mechanism helps capture dependencies between all words in a sentence.

Pre-trained models are fine-tuned on multilingual datasets, allowing accurate translation even across complex language pairs.
